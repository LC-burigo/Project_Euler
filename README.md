# Project_Euler
### In this repository, are few activities from ProjectEuler.net made in python 
:heavy_exclamation_mark: You can take a look on the website here :arrow_right: [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/)

* Problem 1
> sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below any number \
> ex: below 10, we have 3, 5, 6, 9 with the sum of 23

* Problem 2
> find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence, where number of therms of this Finonacci sequence not exceed a determinated quantity.
> ex: the first 10 numbers in a fibonacci sequence are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. So the sum of the even-valued terms is: 187

* Problem 3
> Find the largest prime factor of a determinated number
> ex: The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. So the largest prime number is 29

* Problem 4
> find the largest palindrome number of two 3-digit numbers
> ex: The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99

* Problem 5
> find the number that can be dividided by each of the number from (a determinated number) to (another determinated number)
> ex :2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder

* Problem 6
> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
> ex: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1² + 2²....+ 10² = 385 
> ex: The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2...+10)² = 3025
> ex: Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025-385=2640

* Problem 7
> find the 10 001st prime number
> ex: by listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13
